First, we distribute 8 to the terms in the parenthesis . 8 (10x + 11) = 6 8 *10x + 8 *11 = 6 80x + 88 = 6 Next we get rid of the constant term on the left hand side by subtracting 88 from both sides . 80x + 88 = 6 80x + 88 - 88 = 6 - 88 80x = -82 Finally, we get x by itself by dividing both sides by 80 . 80 x = -82 80 80 x = -82 80 x = -82 80 Therefore, the value of x that makes 8(10x + 11) = 6 true is x = -82 80 Therefore, x is equal to -82/80.

(add the coefficients of the terms that have an x in them) 2( 11x + 9x ) = -6 2( 20x ) = -6 Next we multiply together the coefficients of x on the left hand side. 2 ( 20 x) = -6 2 * 20 x = -6 40x = -6 Finally, we get x by itself by dividing both sides by 40 . 40 x = -6 40 40 x = -6 40 x = -6 40 Therefore, the value of x that makes 2(11x + 9x) = -6 true is x = -6 40\n",

First, we distribute 3 to the terms in the parenthesis . 3 (2x + 10) = -10 3 *2x + 3 *10 = -10 6x + 30 = -10 Next we get rid of the constant term on the left hand side by subtracting 30 from both sides . 6x + 30 = -10 6x + 30 - 30 = -10 - 30 6x = -40 Finally, we get x by itself by dividing both sides by 6 . 6 x = -40 6 6 x = -40 6 x = -40 6 Therefore, the value of x that makes 3(2x + 10) = -10 true is x = -40 6 Therefore, x is equal to -40/6.
